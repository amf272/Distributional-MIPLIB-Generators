# Distributional MIPLIB generators
This repository contains generators for a subset of domains, the Distributional MIPLIB dataset https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/distributional-miplib/home, a dataset for advancing research on ML-guided Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solving. 
Collection of code for generating distributions of MIP instances. We collect some generators ourselves and mirror others which may disappear.
