"corGenerator" is a generator of instances of the 
Connected Subgraph Problem with Node Costs and Node Profits. 

The synthetic instances generated here exemplify the type of problems one
encounters when solving the Wildlife Corridor Design Problem.

The distribution contains a README file, source code in C, makefile, 
examples, and related papers.

Specifically, the code generates square grid graphs (lattices) of a desired order,
where nodes are associated with costs and utilities, and some nodes are designated as terminals (reserves). 

The program generates ascii files of type ".cor" that encodes a corridor
instance using a special format (see COR_FileFormat.txt).

Compile corEncoder by simply typing "make"

******************************************************************************

Usage:

Usage1 : corEncoder lattice {2f+random R | random R} {uncorrelated | weak} ORDER L D OUTFILE ReserveFree [SEED]
Usage2 : corEncoder graph GRAPHFILE {reserve RESERVEFILE | random R} {uncorrelated | weak} L D OUTFILE ReserveFree [SEED]

---------
Usage1 : corEncoder lattice {2f+random R | random R} {uncorrelated | weak} ORDER L D OUTFILE ReserveFree [SEED]

lattice - the corridor model is a set of ORDERxORDER cells arranged in a lattice;

{2f+random R| random R} one of these parameters has to be selected:
R is the number of reserves
2f+random - this model includes two fixed reserves, the upper left corner and the lower right corner, and the other reserves are picked randomly, R >= 2;
random - in this model, all the reserves are selected randomly;

{uncorrelated | weak} - one of these parameters has to be selected:
uncorrelated - the utilities and costs are generated independently and uniformly from the corresponding intervals: [1, L] and [1, D]
weak - the utility interval is weakly correlated with the cost interval; the utility interval for each node j is computed as: [c_j - D; c_j + D]
			
ORDER is the order of the lattice
L is the upper bound for the cost interval per parcel, each cost c_j is picked from [1,L];
D is the amplitude for the utility interval per parcel, each utiltiy u_j is picked from [c_j - D; c_j + D] when "weak" is selected, and from [1,D] when "uncorelated" is selected;
OUTFILE is the name of the output file (without extension);
ReserveFree is either 0 or 1; 1 meaning that reserve node cost is assigned to be 0
[SEED] is an optional argument. If provided, the random number generator is initialized with SEED.

----------
Usage2 : corEncoder graph GRAPHFILE {reserve RESERVEFILE | random R} {uncorrelated | weak} L D OUTFILE ReserveFree [SEED]

GRAPHFILE is a graph/network file in GML format that specifies the nodes and edges
{reserve RESERVEFILE | random R} one of these parameters has to be selected:
RESERVEFILE is a text file that specifies the nodes that are to be treated as reserves (indexed 0 to N-1)
